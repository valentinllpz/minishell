# Minishell

This [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) project teached us how to build our own minimalistic shell in C. We needed to work in a group of 2 persons to complete this project. We built a [lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) to split the input command into meaningful tokens, which were then parsed and stored in an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). It took time to work on the lexer since we needed to learn depth how [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) handles inputs and reverse engineer it, with the help of documentation.
We then had to work on  file descriptors in order to handle output redirection with pipes. The following commands are built-in: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`. Other commands are called with `execve`.

## ðŸ§­ Usage

1. Clone this repo and access it with `cd`
2. Run `make` to build the image
3. Use `./minishell` to launch it
